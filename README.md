# WT Map Sense
The **WT Map Sense** project aims to collect and visualize player behavior data in various forms, including:
- Heatmaps of player movement to analyze common paths and high-traffic areas.
- Kill zones to identify areas with high kill rates.
- Death zones to highlight where players most frequently die.
- CAS death zones to map areas where players are killed by CAS attacks.

This data can offer insights into gameplay patterns and popular locations on each map, which could be useful for strategy analysis or game design studies.
